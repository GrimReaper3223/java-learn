### Simple Study Project in Java

this project is a simple approach to what I've been learning on the "dev.java" site.

As my studies and knowledge advance, I also intend to advance this project in line with my studies.

***********************************************

### What is this project focused on (initially)?

For now, my focus is to create an app to perform simple tasks (calculate, organize arraya, etc). According to my learning, as I go forward, I hope to make this project take on other proportions.

### Why did I put this project on GitHub?

I decided to upload my first project here for 3 reasons:

     -To cheer me up a bit;
     -To learn how to use GitHub and also its syntax;
     -To be able to access my files from multiple places (e.g.: Review my project via mobile and, if necessary, edit it or implement new things without having to go to the computer);


I hope you liked my initiative! :D. I'm studying about different things (about Linux, cybersecurity and about Java) not only to boost my life, but also I love programming and technology in general ❤️.
