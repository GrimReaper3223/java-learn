# Hello everybody

## Current situation:

It's been a few months since I've been studying Java and... as I have ADHD, I'm sometimes suffering from a lack of medication and prescriptions. So I'm studying according to my limit.

## The reason for the existence of this repository...

I decided to create this security repository to keep my summary files in the cloud.

## ... And the reason for creating summary files:

I decided to make these summaries because, as I spent more or less a month without studying Java, when I was back on track, I decided to review **EVERYTHING** I had already studied (from the beginning, the first lesson to the end of the Java fundamentals).

This decision was very important for me because I ended up discovering a new method to better store the information I am studying.
In the same way that a student needs to write in their notebook what the teacher explains, so that it is stored in their memory, I also need to type summaries of what I studied (and this helped me a lot!)

## Much more than a simple summary...

But not only did I decide to review what I've already studied to summarize everything, but also to check if I'd missed anything (even if small) along the way. And I discovered that, yes, I lost, because I didn't pay enough attention.

One of these things was operations and different types of assignments in Java, such as `+=`, `-=`... , fixed pre/post operations, better assigning the designations of what is a declaration, what is an expression and the which is an instruction, etc.
Things that can be ~~"silly"~~ (since people only focus on large functions and more complex things), but that can replace large, ultra-complex functionalities into something simpler and more refined.

Another reason for these summaries was also because of my code refinement. A refined code (of excellent quality, well-worked and with simple logic) becomes eligible for scalability and implementation of new functionalities. Not to mention that it also becomes a much cleaner code. I'm focusing on this, because I see that it has helped me a lot.

As I study, I will also focus on improving my comments and learning better, on my own (while my studies still don't teach me) about the use of tags (`@author`, `@deprecated`, `@return`, `@param`...) so that JavaDocs become much more intuitive about what the project does

## My new visions:

In the meantime, my mindset has changed a lot about programming style. I'm trying to employ something like "simple works" in all spheres of my learning and its applications. Even understanding something complex, simplifying words, but maintaining the complexity of the operation, has helped me understand and explain very complex things that I could not explain.

## Some small changes...

Some things in the [Classes and Objects](Java-Class-and-Objects.txt) file are about to be changed, as I had a slightly different view regarding certain concepts that I tried to explain. Now, with these concepts reviewed and 'relearned', I can explain clearly and with fewer lines of text how everything works.

## And what will be the end of this branch?

This branch will only have these 2 summary files, as they largely correlate.
When I enter other study sections, I will create new branches that will correspond to summaries of such features.

## About my current direction and new projects...

I really liked the logic that Java makes me use, the reasoning, the philosophy... So I want to be a full stack developer, but more focused on the backend, and use the frontend just to allow other users to make use of the features I implemented. I'm also studying the [Lanterna framework](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna), but I took a break recently because some concepts in this framework come up against things that I don't even know how they work yet (basically). So, before continuing, I feel that I should continue with my studies in Java, until I reach (or close to) the concepts covered by [Lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna), so that I can synchronize my studies. And I'm looking at how I can start learning about `Databases` or storing data in text files. It's very annoying to run an application, enter data (whether configuration or other things) and, as soon as you close the application, this data is lost. So I'm looking at how to resolve this. It would simplify many project ideas that I already have and how to execute them with data saved in `DBs` or text files.

## The final ones!

Anyway. That's it for now. I will update the [Classes and Objects](Java-Class-and-Objects.txt) file according to what I'm learning in Java and also about things that I got wrong and now I'm fixing.
